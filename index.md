I'm a self-taught developer whose main goal at the moment is to stick her hands in all corners of tech. I do web development, electronics prototyping, 3D printing, photography, gaming, and all sorts of other fun things. This blog is where I shove all my thoughts that don't fit on Twitter - this way they can be ignored without disturbing anyone's timeline.

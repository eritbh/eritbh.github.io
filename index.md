I'm a self-taught developer whose main goal at the moment is to stick her hands in all corners of tech. I do web development, electronics prototyping, 3D printing, photography, gaming, and all sorts of other fun things. This blog is where I shove all my thoughts that don't fit on Twitter - this way they can be ignored without disturbing anyone's timeline.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/eritbh) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eritbh), or you can send me an [email](mailto:hello@eritbh.me). If you like what I do, you can donate to me via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/eritbh).

# Hi Here's My Music Taste

someone i know did this first and i hyperfocused on it for like two hours and now i have one too. these sure are some songs

### [in love with a ghost - happy when youre not here (on gay story)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzvGlQ37ano_)

Nice and comfy. I characterize a lot of Gay Story this way; they're just cozy, gentle tracks that feel nice to listen to. Also completely unrelated to the music but ilwag's twitter is fucking amazing and she is an icon.

### [Snail's House - Gemini (on Lumi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG_slWFRFe0)

This one picks up a bit; it has more going on and more time to fully develop. as a pretty wide range of intensity and illustrates a lot of what I like about Snail's House's style. I've been listening to their stuff for so goddamn long and you have no idea how much restraint it took not to just copypaste their entire discography into this list. The rest of Lumi is similar, and [L'ete (album)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz4yJQCoYRHXEN4HtE9_WwrAIBRi0Dna1) is also in the same ballpark, and it's all great.

### [Madeon - Heavy With Hoping (on Good Faith)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5oAIIqbBtc)

I really don't listen to that much electronic music with lyrics! Good Faith is just a really good album! I did not like the vocals in this song very much the first couple times i listened, but they grew on me.

### [City Girl - Endless and Artificial (on Chroma Velocity)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4OrzvAtTHU)

I've listened to this style of electronic music for a very long time, but this is actually a new artist to me - I found this song by chance maybe a couple months ago and haven't listened to much of their other stuff yet. My issue with this style is that it's really easy for stuff to start feeling repetitive, and that does happen a little bit in this track too, but it keeps things interesting enough that I keep it in my library.

### [Porter Robinson - Everything Goes On (single)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izHyKdrSKvo)

What can I even say about Porter Robinson. Emotional lyrics and this track is good at bending the melody in spots to make things hit harder. Yeah I listened to a lot of Worlds in high school. What about it. [Nurture (album)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lMhFuCeiEiW--Hv8FMRMu9vMG38E0EwlU) is also very thematically similar, almost to the point of feeling a bit same-y, but it's a really good album if you like this vibe.

### [Grand Pax - Bunk (single)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWvbpxlZbFA)

This I was nudged towards recently by a partner who tends to listen to darker, more experimental stuff than me. I like it quite a bit - it's definitely not as bright as the rest of what I tend to listen to, but it feels well balanced. Another track in the same vein is [GnB Chili - Save Me (single)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN-pisxn2JY).

### [biosphere - strangers (single)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oRlbl8UqL8)

Another recent discovery for me! Calm, simple, slow instrumental; Korean vocals; English rap sections. I have no idea why this works but my brain loves it. I really don't listen to that much rap but i should, flows like this are so satisfying.

### [Snail's House - Popsicle (on Ordinary Songs 5)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB6TJysRcck)

Okay here's my reused artist. Snail's House has so much stuff, and this is one of their higher-energy tracks. All the Ordinary Songs albums are downloaded to my phone and I got *so much* mileage out of these for listening to in the car in high school. They're still some of my favorite focus music, though with the more pop-esque stuff it can get hard not to be distracted tapping along to the beats. If you like this please do yourself a favor and just go listen to literally every other Ordinary Songs album. Yes there are actually five of them. They are all good. I do not know what to tell you.

### [omniboi - Flightplan (on Day Dream)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQhOEvh5juI)

Heavy in creative samples that establish a good rhythm while building up to the melody; this one develops really nicely. Reminds me of early Shawn Wasabi tracks I saw on Youtube (though I haven't really enjoyed any of his recent stuff as much). [Snail's House - Vivid Green (on L'ete)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmhz3_mHjP0) has a similar style with using lots of samples.

### [Lena Raine - Aurora (on Oneknowing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YslPg5LPC58)

Oneknowing is a really good, calming album. Not necessarily cozy, exactly, but it does get me in a certain mood. Good for quiet moments. It was between this and Light Rail to close out the list

### hi here's some other random shit at the end

- I was reminded Anamanaguchi exists after I had already picked these 10 and didnt feel like redoing it so let me state for the record that their stuff is really cool
- Another track I wanted to recommend was [Park Bird - opposum aerodynamics (on Boundaries)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edsb9gsFk1c) and I couldn't figure out which of these tracks it would be most similar to but it's also good and it has a fantastic name so I wanted to include it here

### in conclusion

i have been wearing earbuds for nearly four hours and my ears are in pain. thank u for reading

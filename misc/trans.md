title: what the fuck is a trans
excerpt: hi i wrote way too much sorry
---

so like, my experience with transness is a bit weird, because it started off when i was in high school with a bunch of members of my online friend group coming out as transfem within the span of like, a year? and i was also dating a girl who came out before we even met? and then it becoming a meme that everyone in our friend group would eventually come out as trans? and also a bunch of the cis guys in the same friend group also coming up with female personas for themselves?? like coming up with female names that would suit them and stuff like that??? and i eventually got teased into picking a female name too? and eventually the dude who started that ended up leaving our mutual circles and we sorta just moved on from it i guess

so like, i knew that trans people existed, i had a rough idea of how transition worked, i was *literally dating a trans person* from that group for nearly two years, i had ***picked a female name***, and i did try to consider at some point in there "maybe i'm actually trans?" but eventually decided "nah i'm comfy being a weird cis dude it's probably fine"

and then three years pass, right

so the first thing i really remember from when i started to consider my gender more was in, like, summer 2020 ish? i don't remember what led up to it, but i was just sitting there laying on my bed resting for a minute, on my back, feet up on the bed, and i sort of just looked down at my body, my chest and my legs, and had the thought "i wonder if i could like this body more if it were more feminine." and that was sort of the start of me actually thinking about things more seriously. unlike before, the thought was sort of stuck in my head, nagging me to do something about it this time. i went back and forth a lot, and a lot of my thoughts revolved around how "okay" i had always felt presenting male. i was never really *uncomfortable*, really? i didn't put much effort into my appearance or anything, but i also never had any strong feelings about my body being *wrong*, necessarily.

reading https://genderdysphoria.fyi helped a lot; i was able to connect a lot of my own past experiences to things talked about there, and it was validating to know that i wasn't alone in having those thoughts in my head. i also remember reading a tweet that i can't find now, but i wrote it down in my journal at the time. it was about allowing myself to focus less on whether or not something was *wrong* and more on doing shit that made things *better* for me:

> there aren't any rules to being trans; the feeling that there ARE rules, and that you're going to BREAK them, is just the lingering lament of all the years you spent trying to fit into a gender mold that didn't suit you. just do whatever you want & that will be right.

by the time i started experimenting with different clothes and stuff, i think internally i already knew i was trans. at that point it was just a matter of finding ways to express it that i was comfortable with, finding out what helped me feel the most okay with myself, and that's taken a lot of time on its own. it's a constant process; things are never really perfect. and, uh, the concept of letting myself try new things, just because they might be enjoyable for myself and not for anyone else, is sort of its own beast for me that i don't really want to get into right now... but like, that's also sort of the core of it. at some point i decided "good enough" was boring and i let myself try new things and it improved the way i live. and here i am! things aren't perfect, but they're better

anyway i hope that's helpful! everyone has their own journey, and thinking about this sort of thing can be really scary and bring up a lot of connected stuff that might seem a lot more complicated to deal with. take it at your own speed and just let yourself try things! it's your life and you deserve to make it as good for yourself as you can. <3

winding down my twitter accounts, going through old stuff and found exactly one thing worth preserving on an old alt, a quote of [an @egregirls tweet](https://twitter.com/egregirls/status/1584729214489890816):

> what will it take to get you properly angry?
>
> you've been used, you've been hit and betrayed, abandoned and picked back up only to be used again.
>
> all your life is a weave of pain, and yet you still don't flash your teeth. let your wings spread. 
>
> what are you waiting for? fight.

at the time, the thought i noted was "what is there to be angry at?"

i still pretty much feel this way. i don't see much point in being angry at people who have treated me poorly. but between then and now, there *has* been at least one instance of me feeling anger. not on my own behalf, but for a friend.

[i posted about it a bit ago.](https://eldritch.cafe/@eribleh/109156800276386840)

> i wish the world were less cruel to my friends
>
> the self-preservation instinct i rebuilt is still mostly working. but god, in this moment i wish i had never fixed it. i want to do so much more for them
>
> it doesn't matter that i've seen it before or that i know it for myself
>
> when someone looks to you, after trying so hard to make it better, the last mask cracking, revealing those terrified eyes, begging you to break them, remake them, so at least they won't hurt you anymore...
>
> i want to rip this world to shreds for daring to do this to her

barring myself from having emotions towards my negative past because "it's irrational and unhelpful"?

but if something happens to someone i care about, then of *course* i get mad about it, there's no way they deserve that?

something i remember reading about a while ago is techniques for processing emotions in a healthy way. it talked about allowing yourself to be conscious of emotions, feel them fully, and then allowing yourself to move on from them. that the purpose of emptions is simply to be felt.

i didn't fully understand it at the time, but i think there's a pretty obvious angle to take in light of this: i should probably figure out how to let myself feel anger for myself. it's not as if i've *never* felt angry, or even as if i've never acted out of anger before. but i learned... not to feel that way, i guess.

my family was an angry household for a long time (at least, it feels like a long time). i specifically remember arguments between my little sibling and my dad. shouting matches right outside the door of our shared room. i hated the noise; it was impossible to block out. asking them to stop never worked; being angry at them for arguing only made things worse. i remember a couple occasions where i was called out specifically to sit in the middle of it, expected to somehow mediate things between them because i was the quiet one - i was considered "impartial" for some reason.

i dunno, is that a normal thing? it feels kinda fucked to me. you ever get in a shouting match with your kid and feel like the sensible way to resolve it is to take the other kid (who's trying to pretend it isn't happening) and drag them directly into the middle of it?

so i uh, i picked up conflict avoidance strategies early. and kinda swore off anger as an emotion. even after dad got some help for his anger issues, he still calls me the "calm" or "reasonable" one. it's not even an inaccurate description, i think, just... one i wish i hadn't earned at that age.

and now i guess it's time for me to try to recover from that "all or nothing" view of emotions. i need to relearn how to feel anger for myself. how to feel anger without scaring myself. learning to let those emotions through again, and feel them properly, and process them for what they are. letting myself experience emotions without letting them control me, without being afraid of them or of how i might respond to them.

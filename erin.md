I'm a developer! Mostly a web developer. Sometimes also other types of developer. Also I do embedded systems and other hardware things sometimes. Big tech nerd all around. I'm currently wrapping up my computer science study, and I also work as a software development intern. I spend a lot of my free time maintaining my personal projects and contributing to some others, which you can learn more about [over here](/projects).

Other than the whole "tech" thing, I use she/her pronouns and I'm trans and various other forms of queer. I sometimes do photography, which you can check out [this way](/photos). I also play various video games and I shitpost on social media a lot and I like cats and being comfy and having good friends and uhh that's pretty much it I think.

If you like what I do, consider [donating to me on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/eritbh)!

title: Stuff I Do
modified: 2023-06-01

I'm a maintainer of a few open-source projects:

- [Toolbox for Reddit](https://github.com/toolbox-team/reddit-moderator-toolbox), a browser extension for Reddit moderators
- [The /r/anime subreddit theme](https://github.com/r-anime/stylesheet)
- A bunch of other miscellaneous infrastructure and administration stuff for /r/anime

I have several personal projects that are stable and useful enough for others to consider using:

- A command framework for Discord bots, called [Yuuko](https://eritbh.me/yuuko), written for Typescript and built on [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris)
- A personal set of [user styles](/userstyles) which I've generalized enough to be useful to others
- A set of [titlebar themes for KDE Plasma](https://github.com/eritbh/kde-application-titlebar-themes) for matching with specific application coloe schemes
- A [collection of SSH utilities for 1Password users](https://github.com/eritbh/1password-ssh-utils) which I've [blogged](/2021/01/01/storing-ssh-keys-in-1password) [about](/2022/01/25/1password-ssh-keys-improved) in the past
- [The most niche browser extension to ever exist](https://github.com/eritbh/new-reddit-comment-faces) for /r/anime users

I also have several personal projects which are not at all ready for others to use:

- Some [pointless](https://github.com/eritbh/toolbox-api) [Javascript](https://github.com/eritbh/another-logger) [libraries](https://github.com/eritbh/emit-deprecation)
- A [utility](https://github.com/eritbh/rl-overlay-generator) for easily generating real-time Rocket League OBS overlays from Adobe Illustrator documents for RL streamers and esports organizations
- A couple hardware projects for [controlling LEDs via WiFi](https://github.com/eritbh/esp01-led-controller) and [experimenting with FPGAs and video capture](https://github.com/eritbh/flextest)
